# BMS
Battery Management system


**Introduction**

A Battery Management System (BMS) is an electronic system that is designed
to monitor, regulate, and protect a rechargeable battery. It ensures the safe and
efficient operation of the battery, helps extend its life, and prevents damage to the
battery and other system components. Battery Management Systems (BMS) are
used for several important reasons:

Safety: Batteries can be dangerous if not properly managed. Overcharging, overdischarging,
over-current, and short-circuits can cause thermal runaway, which can
lead to damage or even a fire. The BMS protects the battery and other system
components from these conditions, ensuring the safe operation of the battery.

Performance: The BMS helps to extend the life of the battery by regulating the
charging and discharging process, and by balancing the voltage of individual cells
in a multi-cell battery pack. This ensures that the battery is operating at optimal
performance and extends its lifespan.

Reliability and Cost-effectiveness: The BMS provides a more reliable and efficient
system by monitoring the battery’s State of Charge (SOC) and State of Health
(SOH), and by communicating with other system components. The BMS helps to
reduce costs by reducing the need for maintenance and replacement of the battery.

Compliance: Many applications, such as electric vehicles and aerospace, have
strict regulations and safety requirements that must be met. The BMS helps to
ensure compliance with these regulations by providing protection and monitoring
functions that meet the required standards.


**Objective**

The objectives of this work were defined as follows:
1. To study battery parameters in detail and to do detailed analysis of Battery
Management System.
2. To study the tests performed on batteries and develop the required experimental
testing to validate the concept.
3. To sense the voltage and current from the battery pack using a microcontroller
as Ardunio uno.
4. To study the different ways to determine the SoC and its algorithms.
5. To estimate the SoC of battery by using Coulomb counting method using a
microcontroller.
6. To prepare a module that display’s the Voltage, Current, temperature and
SoC of the battery pack on a LCD display.
7. Comparative study of Cell balancing technique and implementation of Active
cell balancing technique in a module.

**Battery Performance Parameter**

SOC: The percentage of the battery’s capacity that is currently available for use.

State of health (SoH): The overall health and performance of the battery, often
measured as a percentage of the battery’s original capacity.

Energy density: The energy density of a battery is a measure of the amount of
energy stored per unit volume or mass.

Power density: The power density of a battery is a measure of the amount of
power that can be delivered per unit volume or mass.

Life Cycle: The life cycle of a battery refers to the total number of charge and
discharge cycles that a battery can go through before it reaches the end of its useful
life. The life cycle of a battery is an important consideration for applications that
require frequent charging and discharging, such as portable electronics, electric
vehicles, and renewable energy storage systems

Voltage: The electric potential difference between the battery’s terminals.

Current: The flow of electric charge through the battery.

Temperature: The temperature of the battery, as high temperatures can reduce
battery performance and lifespan. Capacity: The total amount of energy that the
battery can store.

Power: The rate at which energy is being drawn from or supplied to the battery.
Calendar life: measures how the battery’s performance changes over time, even
when it is not in use.
